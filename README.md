This is the Myntra product information page, where I created a responsive and interactive web page that displays a list of products. Each product includes an image, title, description, and price. Users should be able to filter and sort the products based on their attributes (e.g., price, category). Additionally, implement a user-friendly pagination system to navigate through the product list.

#HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
1) Just download the code and add your json file in productactioncreator.js
2) Open it to VSCode
3) and run terminal
4) npm i
5) npm start

Congratulations you are in the website!

You can also visit the site as it is deployed in the repository.
